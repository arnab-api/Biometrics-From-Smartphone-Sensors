# Biometrics-From-Smartphone-Sensors

The features were extracted using idea from the paper [Person Recognition using Smartphones' Accelerometer Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04689).
Then trained a **Triplet Network** architecture based on that data. Worked well for a small dataset of 6 people. But it may be *biased* 
and/or *overfitted*. Need more data for generalization
